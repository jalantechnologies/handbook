# Working at Better
## Collaboration & Working Hours
While it is important that each team member has flexibility to work at times that work best for them, it is also important that they have effective collaboration hours with their immediate team members.

### Working Hours
Set your working hours (and keep it up to date) in your status message on MS teams, ensure a minimum of **4 overlapping hours** with team's collaboration hours. Please be **online** and **available** during work hours. It is generally considered not professional, if for any reason you're not available, without prior update on MS team's channel.

### Daily Status Update
Start your day by sharing a status update on your primary project workspace with:

- Plan – What you'll work on
- Problems – Any blockers

At the end of the day, reply to the same thread with what you completed. This keeps everyone aligned and shows follow-through. Please make sure to include as much detail as possible, hyperlink artifacts being referred in the message so its easy to follow your progress without talking to you.

Daily updates are part of our work culture. If you don’t post them, we usually assume you're not working.

## Common Work Channels:
Other than your primary project workspace, these are common channels that you should know:

## Meetings
It is expected for you to attend key team meetings. It helps everyone to be on the same page.

- Engineering: Standup, exit, retro, company all hands
- Recruitment, marketing: Weekly Sync Up or as directed by lead, company all hands

During meeting, please:

- Turn on video in both internal and external communication. It is generally considered not professional not to do so
- Be on time. Respect other people time.
- Be patient. Listen first. Understand other's perspective first. Speak after.

While we are on the topic of meetings, please be mindful of team member time when you call for meetings. Please share the agenda few days before the meeting in a document and invite for comments.

## Time Off Policy
Please plan and inform your time off a week before. To take time off,

- Let your team and customer know on appropriate team channel
- Update in company HRMS system
- Update your status on MS teams. For ex, if you are on leave from 1/10-1/15, set something as 'OOO: 1/10-1/15'

You do not need to seek approval from anyone. We trust that you will do the right thing keeping everyone's interest in mind. Last minute time off, except medical emergencies, are discouraged as it disrupts work flow.

### Communication
Due to the nature of remote work, you are expected to adjust your communication style to optimize for asynchronous working. This means that you should prefer things in writing over verbal communication and write with clarity. Write a document or message in detail and invite comments from others to collaborate. Write verbosely to remove guess work from other team members.

For example: `I am stuck at XXX. Can someone help me?` This is not a sufficient message - rather tell folks what all things you tried, raise a PR and push your changes and then ask for help. These are just an example, best to Google “How to seek help at the workplace” to learn more and do some independent thinking.

We also prefer that you use your work related channels on MS Teams over direct messaging to make the information accessible and transparent to other team members and remove any gaps in decision making.
