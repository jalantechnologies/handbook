# Software Engineering Philosophy

Software engineering culture is much more than just writing good code. Ultimately, software should help a company achieve its goals and make money, both from new and existing sources. If it doesn't do that, it's not fulfilling its purpose.

> Software engineering isn't only about learning algorithms or solving coding puzzles, or being skilled in a specific technology like React JS. It's about using your product to solve real problems.

## Project vs Product Mindset

Software development is a part of the broader product engineering process. There are many layers to product engineering, including market and user research, competitive analysis, quality assurance, and software development. Each of these aspects should interest a software developer.

Focusing only on following a list of business requirements and delivering a final product without contributing beyond that is a **project-based approach**. It's not as effective as having a broader understanding of product feature development. Software developers should view themselves as consultants because they have a valuable role in the product's success.

If software developers understand the business better, they can ask "why" more often. They can question the requirements and design to understand where the project fits into the business' overall goals.

With this knowledge, they can make informed decisions about the product based on data. By being more engaged, developers can earn the client's trust, take more ownership, and hopefully create a successful product. This is a **Product-based approach**.

## \***\*Why data-driven decisions are so important in product engineering\*\***

Product-minded engineers are developers who care deeply about the product itself. They understand that each software product should provide value to end customers. They want to know why decisions are made, how people use the product, and be involved in making product choices.

It's easy for developers to get lost in details and forget the bigger picture. Product-minded thinking is about finding the balance between these details and the needs of the product's market and users.

Software engineers should also regularly review user analytics to understand the audience and their behaviors. Tools like Google Analytics and error reporting help with this.

_Imagine a situation where 60% of users are on small laptops, but the development team uses 4K retina screens. And they discovered that the content they had developed was too big for the average user’s smaller screens and was forcing them to scroll._

Understanding the user base in this scenario can lead to better product development. Knowing how users interact with a product can help developers push back on client requests or suggest better resource usage.

## **Product Mindset – The Sweet Spot**

The product mindset is the central point in the journey of a product.

The product mindset sits at the intersection of business requirements, technical feasibility and meeting the user’s needs.

## **Standing out as a developer in a competitive market:**

Instead of just focusing on technical skills, developers should show broader skills and an interest in the industry and the client's business development.

Knowing how to code is good, but being able to give detailed feedback is even better.

_Imagine two friends, A and B, in a job interview. A talks about technical skills, while B explains how they improved the company's product and increased user satisfaction by x%. Who do you think would likely get the job? Probably B, because businesses want to make money and keep customers happy._

> We don't need engineers who create cool but unhelpful features. What's crucial is engineers who create features that are useful and effective.

Being a **product-minded engineer** is important.

### Here are some key traits of product-minded engineers:

1. They suggest product ideas and opinions, not just follow specifications.
2. They understand the business, user behavior, and relevant data.
3. They're curious and want to understand the "why" behind things.
4. They communicate well and build relationships with non-engineers.
5. They consider trade-offs between product and engineering.
6. They handle edge cases practically, reducing unnecessary work.
7. They seek early feedback to validate product features.
8. They take end-to-end ownership of features and care about real-world results.
