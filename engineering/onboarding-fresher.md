# Onboarding Freshers

At JTC, we build products that solve real life problems. For example: we are working with a solar company to build an application to help them analyse roof space to understand how much solar energy can be generated at the location. For a large part, the solutions we deliver are based on web technologies. As of writing this document, our choice of stack is **Typescript, Node, React**.

This document assumes that you have no or minimal experience with this stack of professional software development in general. However, it assumes that you are proactive, independent and strong problem solving skills to be able to figure out things on your own. If you do, we hope that you should be able to move through this quickly.

In order to help you learn MERN stack related technology, we rely on [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). We believe its a curriculum well designed.

## Learning Path:

### 1: Fundamentals

Link: [https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)

Expected time to finish\*: ~2 weeks

### 2: Full stack development using Javascript

Link: [https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

Expected time to finish\*:

-   Javascript: 1.5 weeks
-   React: 2.5 weeks
-   Node: 3.5 weeks

\*The above timeline assumes you are putting in at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Before you start working, please make sure you do following:

## Logistics:

### Github handle for work:

There are two options:

1. Use personal Github handle (**recommended**): Add your JTC work email as [secondary email to your Github](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) handle. And on the repo locally do:

    ```
    $ git config user.name <YOUR NAME>
    $ git config user.email <YOUR WORK EMAIL>
    ```

    This way, you build your personal Github profile while doing commit on behalf of the company.

2. Create a separate JTC specific Github handle.

### Mentor

At the time of joining, you will be assigned a mentor who will be your single point of contact on Engineering as you go through the onboarding

### Daily Standup:

Every day, please send your daily status update to `Onboarding (Engineering)` channel. Here is a sample format of daily status update:

```
Progress:
-------------
- Read JTC development process
- Completed day 1 eng-onboarding exercise

Plan:
-------------
- Start on understanding Node boilerplate
- Start on building TODO application repo

Problems:
-------------
- None
```

### Demo Day:

Every two weeks, there will be a demo day where you will be asked to present all the projects you completed as part of curriculum.
