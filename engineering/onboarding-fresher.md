# Onboarding Freshers

At JTC, we primarily work with enterprises to build solutions that help them to achieve business efficiencies and scale their business. For a large part, the solutions we deliver are based on web technologies. As of writing this document, our choice of stack is **Typescript, Node, React**.

This document assumes that you have no or minimal experience with this stack of professional software development in general. However, it assumes that you are proactive, independent and have strong problem solving skills to be able to figure out things on your own. If you do, we hope that you should be able to move through this quickly.

In order to help you learn MERN stack related technology, we rely on [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). We believe it's a curriculum well designed.

## Learning Path

### 1. Fundamentals

Curriculum Link: [https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)

Expected time to finish: ~2 weeks\*

### 2. Full stack development using Javascript

Curriculum Link: [https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

Expected time to finish:

-   Javascript: 1.5 weeks\*
-   React: 2.5 weeks\*
-   Node: 3.5 weeks\*

NOTE:

-   \*The above timeline assumes you are putting in at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.
-   \*\*Reminder: Please do not rush through or try to keep things to be done last minute or finish just for the sake of finishing. This is an opportunity for you to build YOUR skills. If you do not give 100%, we have seen over and over that such engineers do not end up performing well when they work on a real product with us.

## Logistics

### Mentor

At the time of joining, you will be assigned a mentor who will be your single point of contact on Engineering as you go through the onboarding. If not, please reach out to HR to ask for your mentor.

### Daily Standup:

Every day, please send your daily status update to `Onboarding (Engineering)` channel. Here is a sample format of daily status update:

```
Progress:
-------------
- Read JTC development process
- Completed day 1 eng-onboarding exercise

Plan:
-------------
- Start on understanding Node boilerplate
- Start on building TODO application repo

Problems:
-------------
- None
```

### Demo Day:

Every two weeks, there will be a demo day where you will be asked to present all the projects you completed as part of curriculum.

### Github handle for work

There are two options:

1. Use personal Github handle (**recommended**): Add your JTC work email as [secondary email to your Github](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) handle.

    ```
    $ git config --global user.name <YOUR NAME>
    $ git config --global user.email <YOUR WORK EMAIL>
    ```

    This way, you build your personal Github profile while doing commit on behalf of the company.

2. Create a separate JTC specific Github handle.
