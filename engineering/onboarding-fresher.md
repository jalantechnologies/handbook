# Onboarding Freshers

At JTC, we build products that solve real life problems. For example: we are working with a solar company to build an application to help them analyse roof space to understand how much solar energy can be generated at the location.

For a large part, the solutions we deliver are based on web technologies. As of writing this document, our choice of stack is Typescript, Node, React. The common language used for building the application is Javascript.

This document assumes that you have no or minimal experience with this stack of professional software development in general. If you do, we hope that you should be able to move through this quickly.

### GOAL 1: Complete [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) Full Stack Developer (JS)

**Mentor**: Will be assigned at time of joining. Please speak with your HR.
**Expected time to finish**: ~2 months

- Fundamentals: 1 week
- Javascript: 1.5 weeks
- React: 2.5 weeks
- Node: 3.5 weeks

The above timeline assumes you are putting in at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Before you start working, please make sure you do following:

#### Step 1: Setup Github Handle for Work

There are two options:

1. Use personal Github handle (**recommended**): Add your JTC work email as [secondary email to your Github](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) handle. And on the repo locally do:

   ```
   $ git config user.name <YOUR NAME>
   $ git config user.email <YOUR WORK EMAIL>
   ```

   This way, you build your personal Github profile while doing commit on behalf of the company.

2. Create a separate JTC specific Github handle.

#### Step 2: Setup IDE

Every team member has their preference but we generally use VSCode. Please also install a [prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to make sure the code you write in any project is well formatted.

**Remember:** Every day, please send your daily status update to `eng-onboarding` in the Slack channel. Here is a sample format of daily status update:

```

-------------
- Read JTC development process
