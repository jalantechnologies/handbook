# Engineering:

Software engineering is much more than writing good code. Ultimately, software should help a company achieve its goals and make money, both from new and existing sources. If it doesn't do that, it's not fulfilling its purpose. When software developers understand the business better, they can ask "why" more often. They can question the requirements and design to understand where the project fits into the business' overall goals. With this knowledge, they can make informed decisions about the product based on data. By being more engaged, developers can earn the client's trust, take more ownership, and hopefully create a successful product. Here are some key traits of product-minded engineers:

1. They suggest product ideas and opinions, not just follow specifications.
2. They understand the business, user behavior, and relevant data.
3. They're curious and want to understand the "why" behind things.
4. They communicate well and build relationships with non-engineers.
5. They consider trade-offs between product and engineering.
6. They handle edge cases practically, reducing unnecessary work.
7. They seek early feedback to validate product features.
8. They take end-to-end ownership of features and care about real-world results.

_Imagine a situation where 60% of users are on small laptops, but the development team uses 4K retina screens. And they discovered that the content they had developed was too big for the average user’s smaller screens and was forcing them to scroll._

Understanding the user base in this scenario can lead to better product development. Knowing how users interact with a product can help developers push back on client requests or suggest better resource usage. Software engineers should also regularly review user analytics to understand the audience and their behaviors. Tools like Google Analytics and error reporting help with this.
