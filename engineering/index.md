# Engineering:
## Overview
Software engineering is much more than writing good code. Ultimately, software should help a company achieve its goals and make money, both from new and existing sources. If it doesn't do that, it's not fulfilling its purpose. When software developers understand the business better, they can ask "why" more often. They can question the requirements and design to understand where the project fits into the business' overall goals. With this knowledge, they can make informed decisions about the product based on data. By being more engaged, developers can earn the client's trust, take more ownership, and hopefully create a successful product. Here are some key traits of product-minded engineers:

1. They suggest product ideas and opinions, not just follow specifications.
2. They understand the business, user behavior, and relevant data.
3. They're curious and want to understand the "why" behind things.
4. They communicate well and build relationships with non-engineers.
5. They consider trade-offs between product and engineering.
6. They handle edge cases practically, reducing unnecessary work.
7. They seek early feedback to validate product features.
8. They take end-to-end ownership of features and care about real-world results.

_Imagine a situation where 60% of users are on small laptops, but the development team uses 4K retina screens. And they discovered that the content they had developed was too big for the average userâ€™s smaller screens and was forcing them to scroll._

Understanding the user base in this scenario can lead to better product development. Knowing how users interact with a product can help developers push back on client requests or suggest better resource usage. Software engineers should also regularly review user analytics to understand the audience and their behaviors. Tools like Google Analytics and error reporting help with this.

## Getting started
### How we work
Please ensure that you have reviewed [company working principles](/common/working_at_better.html). Read it twice, in detail, as 99% often overlook the details and often causes mismatch of expectations.

### Setup Git
Since our source code is stored on Github, you need a Github handle to contribute. There are two options:

1. Use personal Github handle (**recommended**): Add your Better work email as [secondary email to your Github](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) handle.

```
$ git config --global user.name <YOUR NAME>
$ git config --global user.email <YOUR WORK EMAIL>
```

This way, you build your personal Github profile while doing commit on behalf of the company.

2. Create a separate Better specific Github handle.

###  IDE
Every team member has their preference but we generally use VSCode. Please also install a [prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to make sure the code you write in any project is well formatted.

###  Raising PRs
We encourage you to raise your PR daily, push your changes, once you are done for the day, a PR on Github to merge these changes against the develop branch. Please see raising [pull request etiquette](/engineering/pr-etiquette).

### Important soft skills to pay attention to
1.  Avoiding repetition of mistakes: While mistakes are a natural part of the learning process, we value individuals who can take feedback, learn from their mistakes and apply that knowledge to prevent repetition.
2.  Learning aptitude: We look for individuals who have the ability to learn new concepts and technologies in-depth, and apply their knowledge to create high-quality solutions. Strong fundamentals are a plus.
3.  Problem-solving: We value team members who can find solutions to their problems independently, particularly with regard to out-of-the-box technologies.
4.  Code quality: As an engineering company, we prioritize craftsmanship in code writing and look for individuals who have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles.
5.  Communication: Effective communication is essential in the workplace. We place a high value on team members who can clearly and concisely convey their thoughts and ideas.
6.  Commitment: We look for individuals who can be relied upon to deliver on their commitments and support the team and customers alike.
