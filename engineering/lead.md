## Engineering Lead:

At some point in your career at Better, you will be asked to take up an engineering lead role, even when you are sometime not ready, in the product you are working. As a lead, you are responsible to:

-   Work with product manager to create technical architecture based on the PRD document (ref: [PM Handbook](https://github.com/jalantechnologies/handbook/blob/main/product-management/index.md))
-   Work with product manager to plan the work and allocate it among team members
-   Proactively monitor progress on each ticket in the sprint, whether assigned to you or others, and ensure team completes them by the sprint exit
-   Review ALL PRs of the team members
-   Proactively monitor live site issues and resolve them within 24 hours or asap
-   Demo all the tickets from a business standpoint during the sprint exit demo
-   Proactively monitor technical debts in the code base and find ways to resolve them
-   Measure team members performance and work with management to staff the team appropriately

If you have been asked to work as a lead, it is expected that you will be spending 20%-50% time as a lead (depending on the product) and rest of the time as an individual contributor.
