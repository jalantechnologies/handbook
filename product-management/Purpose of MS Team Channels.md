3. Pin important announcements or documents for easy access.
4. Avoid technical discussions or PR reviews in this channel; redirect them to the appropriate channels.
5. Regularly update tabs to ensure links are current and accessible.

## 2. Engineering Channel
**Purpose:** 

The Engineering channel is dedicated to technical discussions, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among the engineering team. It serves as a space for resolving technical challenges and reviewing engineering artifacts.

**Use Cases:**

1. Engineering Discussions: Discuss architecture, code design, or technical challenges.
2. Asking Engineering Questions: Team members can seek help or clarification on technical issues.
3. Sharing Documents for Review: Share technical documentation, such as architecture diagrams or code snippets, for peer review.

**Tabs to Add:**

1. ERD (Engineering Requirement Document): Direct access to the latest ERD document to learn about the product's engineering architecture.
2. GitHub: Direct access to the code repository of the product. 

**Best Practices:**

1. Use threads to keep discussions organized and avoid cluttering the main channel.
2. Tag relevant team members with @mentions for specific questions or reviews.
3. Share documents in a structured format to facilitate reviews.
4. Avoid non-engineering topics; redirect product or stakeholder discussions to the General channel.

## 3. PR Review Channel
**Purpose:** 

The PR Review channel streamlines the code review process by providing a dedicated space for submitting and reviewing pull requests (PRs). It ensures transparency and collaboration between engineers and PMs during the review process.

**Use Cases:**

1. Submitting PRs for review with all necessary details to enable efficient and thorough evaluations.
2. PR Review Requirements:
   1. Jira Ticket: Include the Jira ticket link of the task or feature.
   2. PR Link: Provide the GitHub pull request link for code review.
   3. Loom Video: Share a short Loom video demonstrating the feature or changes in action.
   4. Preview Environment Link: Provide a link to the preview environment where PMs can test the feature.

**Best Practices:**

1. Use a consistent above-mentioned PR submission template for clarity.
2. Notify reviewers with @mentions to expedite the review process.
3. Respond promptly to feedback or questions in the thread to keep reviews moving.
4. Avoid posting unrelated discussions; keep the channel focused on PR reviews.

## 4. QA Channel
**Purpose:**

The QA channel is dedicated to quality assurance activities, enabling PMs and testers to report bugs, share QA notes, and discuss testing outcomes. It ensures issues are tracked and resolved efficiently.

**Use Cases:**

1. PMs and testers share QA notes, test results, and bug reports with associated Jira tickets.
2. Discuss and prioritize bug fixes with the engineering team.
3. Track the resolution of reported issues.

**Best Practices:**

1. Include Jira ticket in all bug reports for traceability.
2. Use a clear format for bug reports (e.g., description, steps to reproduce, screenshots, video if needed).
3. Tag relevant team members (e.g., @engineer or @PM) to ensure quick responses.
4. Avoid general discussions; redirect non-QA topics to other channels.

## 5. Sprint Planning and Exit Channel
**Purpose:** 

The Sprint Planning and Exit channel facilitates sprint-related activities, including planning, exit, and retro outcomes. It ensures alignment across the team during each sprint cycle.

**Use Cases:**

1. Sprint Planning: PM shares the Sprint Plan document at the start of the sprint, outlining goals, tasks, and priorities.
2. Sprint Discussions: Team members discuss sprint progress, blockers, or adjustments to the plan.
3. Sprint Exit: On the last day of the sprint, PMs remind team members to add demos or outcomes to the Sprint document.

**Tabs to Add:**

1. Sprint Folder in Confluence: Direct access to the dedicated folder containing all sprint-related documents.

**Best Practices:**

1. Share the Sprint Plan document at the start of each sprint.
2. Use threads for sprint-specific discussions to keep the channel organized.
3. Encourage team members to add demos (e.g., Loom videos) to the Sprint document for transparency.

## 5. Alert Channel
**Purpose:** 

The Alert channel is a critical monitoring tool for the production environment. It receives automated alerts for issues detected in the production app, ensuring the team can respond promptly to maintain stability.

**Use Cases:**

1. Automated alerts from monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) are sent to this channel when production issues are detected.
2. PMs and engineers monitor the channel daily to identify and address potential issues.
3. Prioritize and document production incidents in Jira.

**Best Practices:**

1. Set up integrations (with the help of the platform or engineering team) with monitoring tools to ensure alerts are routed correctly.
2. Respond to alerts promptly and create Jira tickets for tracking issues.
3. Use threads to discuss specific alerts to keep the channel organized.
4. Avoid non-alert-related posts to maintain focus on production issues.

# Setup Instructions

1. Create Team & Channels: Set up a dedicated team and each channel with clear names (e.g., “General”, “Engineering”, “PR Review”) for every new project.
2. Add Tabs: Configure tabs in each channel as specified, ensuring links are accessible and up-to-date.
3. Configure Integrations: Set up production's monitoring tools and connect to Alert Channel.
4. Invite Team: PM needs to ensure each team member who is part of the project is invited to the MS team and has access to all the channels.
