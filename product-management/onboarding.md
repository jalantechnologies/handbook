### Onboarding

The goal of this document is to ensure that by the start of every project, you can confidently answer the following questions:

	1. Do I know which sprint ceremonies I’m expected to lead or participate in, and what my role is in each?
	2. Do I have a clear understanding of the daily processes and steps to follow until the project is completed?
	3. Do I understand all the processes that have been set up for this specific project?
	4. Have I met all the relevant stakeholders and aligned everyone on the plan of action?
