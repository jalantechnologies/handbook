<p>Here’s what you get when you work at Better.</p>

<h3 id="remote-friendly-work">Remote-Friendly Work</h3>
<p>We’re a fully remote company. You can work from anywhere as long as you have a stable internet connection and overlap with your team for at least 4 working hours a day.</p>

<p><strong>Laptop Policy</strong>
We provide laptops to full-time employees (FTEs). This usually takes 2–3 weeks after joining. Please have a personal machine available to work from during this initial period.</p>

<h3 id="compensation">Compensation</h3>
<p>Salary is credited on or before the 5th business day of the following month.</p>

<p>If you join in the middle of a month, your salary is prorated based on actual days worked — for example, if your salary is INR 50,000 and you join on Jan 12, you’ll be paid INR 32,258 (= 50,000 × 20 / 31), credited by Feb 5.</p>

<h3 id="leaves--time-off">Leaves &amp; Time Off</h3>
<p>All team members are entitled to 12 paid leaves, 6 sick leaves, and 14 public holidays in a year.</p>

<p>Leave starts accruing from your first month — if you join on or before the 15th, you accrue one full day of paid leave that month; if you join after the 15th, you accrue half a day. Unused paid leaves can be carried forward to the next year, up to a maximum of 6 days. Sick leaves expire at year-end and cannot be carried forward.</p>

<p>After completing one year at the company, you become eligible to encash any unused paid leaves. Please note that sick leaves are not eligible for encashment. We do not support taking advance leave — you may only use what you’ve already earned.</p>

<p>During your notice period, no new leaves are credited and you are expected not to take any time off. If you forget to apply for leave in Keka, we’ll auto-adjust it from your balance so there’s no confusion.</p>

<h3 id="health-insurance">Health Insurance</h3>
<p>Full-time employees (FTEs) are covered under a group health plan that includes INR 3,00,000 coverage for you, your spouse, and your children. The plan also includes access to remote doctor consultations.</p>

<h3 id="parental-leave">Parental Leave</h3>
<p>If you’re a full-time employee and expecting a child, we offer paid parental leave to support you during this time. Maternity leave is 6 months paid, and paternity leave is 1 month paid. Please reach out to HR when you’re ready to plan this out.</p>

<h3 id="learning--development">Learning &amp; Development</h3>
<p>We provide access to paid courses, certifications, and tools that help you grow in your role. If there’s something specific you’d like to pursue, discuss it with your manager — we’re happy to support learning that adds value to your work.</p>
