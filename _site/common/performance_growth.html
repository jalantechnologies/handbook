      <h1 id="performance--growth">Performance &amp; Growth</h1>
<p>We believe that individual growth drives company growth. Our performance philosophy is centered on clarity, accountability, and consistent support—ensuring everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute meaningfully.</p>

<h2 id="performance-review">Performance Review</h2>
<p>Performance is primarily evaluated on your ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver on commitments: On time and without needing reminders.</li>
  <li>Deliver accurately: With quality, attention to detail, and ownership.</li>
  <li>Deliver independently: Without requiring hand-holding while still collaborating well with others.</li>
</ul>

<p>We don’t believe in rigid rating systems or forced stack-ranking. Instead, we focus on what you deliver, how you deliver it, and how you support others.</p>

<h2 id="promotions">Promotions</h2>
<p>Promotions are based on impact, usually evaluated once a year. If you consistently exceed expectations and help others succeed, we’ll recognize and reward that.</p>

<p>To be considered for a promotion, we typically look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consistently strong individual delivery.</li>
  <li>Proactive ownership and problem-solving.</li>
  <li>Support for team members and clients beyond your core responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Initiative in improving systems, processes, or culture.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="underperformance">Underperformance</h2>
<p>If you’re struggling, that’s okay—we all go through tough periods. What matters is how you respond. If you often miss your commitments, here’s what to expect:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll receive candid, constructive feedback during your 1:1s.</li>
  <li>You’ll get multiple chances to course-correct.</li>
  <li>If things don’t improve after honest effort and support, we’ll ask you to transition out.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also draw a firm line: lying to teammates or clients is non-negotiable and may result in immediate dismissal.</p>

<p>We offer a one-month notice period to help with transitions and job search support wherever possible.</p>

<h2 id="11-with-jai">1:1 with Jai</h2>
<p>We are still a small company, and have a flat hierarchy. 1:1 is a great tool that you can use to bring up your wins, concerns, get feedback or anything that you want to talk related to work. You can book a monthly 1:1 with Jai <a href="https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/f60bbd0e6a6144a098592545d9c6e9fb@bettrhq.com/meetingtype/FAMP3-Pqv0Sjyk5uq4scig2?anonymous&amp;ismsaljsauthenabled&amp;ep=mcard">here</a>. This is your time—use it intentionally.</p>

<p><strong>What to Bring</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Your top 1–2 priorities since our last 1:1</li>
  <li>Any blockers (technical, people, process)</li>
  <li>Wins or milestones you’re proud of</li>
  <li>Feedback or suggestions (for me, the team, or the company)</li>
  <li>Anything else on your mind (goals, growth, motivation, conflicts)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What You Can Expect</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A safe space to speak honestly</li>
  <li>Clarity on expectations and direction</li>
  <li>Honest, constructive feedback (when you ask for it)</li>
  <li>Support with decisions or challenges</li>
  <li>Guidance on your growth path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips to Get the Most Out of It</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be real – no filters needed. The more candid, the better.</li>
  <li>Own the agenda – this is your time to drive.</li>
  <li>Ask for what you need – coaching, recognition, feedback, clarity.</li>
  <li>Follow up async – actions from the 1:1 don’t have to wait for the next meeting.</li>
</ul>
