# Performance & Growth
We believe that individual growth drives company growth. Our performance philosophy is centered on clarity, accountability, and consistent support—ensuring everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute meaningfully.

## Performance Review
Performance is primarily evaluated on your ability to:

* Deliver on commitments: On time and without needing reminders.
* Deliver accurately: With quality, attention to detail, and ownership.
* Deliver independently: Without requiring hand-holding while still collaborating well with others.

We don't believe in rigid rating systems or forced stack-ranking. Instead, we focus on what you deliver, how you deliver it, and how you support others.

## Promotions
Promotions are based on impact, usually evaluated once a year. If you consistently exceed expectations and help others succeed, we'll recognize and reward that.

To be considered for a promotion, we typically look at:

* Consistently strong individual delivery.
* Proactive ownership and problem-solving.
* Support for team members and clients beyond your core responsibilities.
* Initiative in improving systems, processes, or culture.

## Underperformance
If you're struggling, that's okay—we all go through tough periods. What matters is how you respond. If you often miss your commitments, here's what to expect:

1. You'll receive candid, constructive feedback during your 1:1s.
2. You'll get multiple chances to course-correct.
3. If things don't improve after honest effort and support, we'll ask you to transition out.

We also draw a firm line: lying to teammates or clients is non-negotiable and may result in immediate dismissal.

We offer a one-month notice period to help with transitions and job search support wherever possible.

## 1:1 with Jai
We are still a small company, and have a flat hierarchy. 1:1 is a great tool that you can use to bring up your wins, concerns, get feedback or anything that you want to talk related to work. You can book a monthly 1:1 with Jai [here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/f60bbd0e6a6144a098592545d9c6e9fb@bettrhq.com/meetingtype/FAMP3-Pqv0Sjyk5uq4scig2?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled&ep=mcard). This is your time—use it intentionally.

**What to Bring**:
1. Your top 1–2 priorities since our last 1:1
2. Any blockers (technical, people, process)
3. Wins or milestones you're proud of
4. Feedback or suggestions (for me, the team, or the company)
5. Anything else on your mind (goals, growth, motivation, conflicts)

**What You Can Expect**:
* A safe space to speak honestly
* Clarity on expectations and direction
* Honest, constructive feedback (when you ask for it)
* Support with decisions or challenges
* Guidance on your growth path

**Tips to Get the Most Out of It**:
* Be real – no filters needed. The more candid, the better.
* Own the agenda – this is your time to drive.
* Ask for what you need – coaching, recognition, feedback, clarity.
* Follow up async – actions from the 1:1 don't have to wait for the next meeting.
