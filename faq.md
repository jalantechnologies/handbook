# FAQ's


#### 1. How is my salary calculated if I join in the middle of the month?
Your salary would be prorated based on number of days you worked with us since your date of joining to the end of the month. Ex: Your salary is INR 50,000 and you join in Jan 12, 2021. You would get INR 32,258 `(=50000 * (20 / 31))` and paid by Feb 5th.

#### 2. What are the company’s policies regarding leave eligibility, accrual, encashment, carry forward, and leave usage during the notice period?
- **Leave Accrual & Encashment:** You start earning paid leaves from your joining month - if you join on or before the 15th you’ll get 1 day of paid leave that month, or 0.5 day if you join after. After completing **one year with the company**, you're eligible to encash unused paid leaves (note: sick leaves cannot be encashed).
 
- **Carrying Leaves Forward:** At the end of the year, you can carry forward up to 6 days of unused paid leave. Any excess will be forfeited. Sick leaves don’t roll over - they’ll expire at year-end.
 
- **No Advance Leave:** You can use only the leave you've already earned. Unfortunately, you can’t take leave in advance.
 
- **Forgot to Apply Leave in Keka?** No worries - we’ve got you covered. If you forget to apply in Keka, we'll automatically adjust your balance to reflect the leave you took.
 
- **Notice Period Rules:** No leaves allowed once your notice period begins. During notice period, no new paid or sick leaves get credited.
 
- **Why these rules exist (in a nutshell):** To keep everything fair and transparent for everyone. To help you plan better—no surprises at year-end. To ensure policy consistency during critical phases like the notice period.
