Our primary nature of the business is technology consulting and implementation of software systems. Our technology consultants bring clients on board by pitching software solutions and our software engineers work with clients to deliver them. We do not have frontend engineers, backend engineers, project managers. Our engineers take full ownership of features and work alongside with customers to deliver.

We often work on few products of our own as well. If you are looking to work with us, talk to your hiring manager to learn more about our works.
